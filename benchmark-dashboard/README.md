# Benchmark dashboard

Source of truth for the Copse benchmark dashboard published at
<https://copselib.github.io/copse-dotnet/> (the root redirects to `/benchmarks/`).

`index.html` is the whole dashboard: **no build step, no external libraries** (charts are inline
SVG, so chart text is real selectable/searchable DOM). It reads `window.BENCHMARK_DATA` from a
sibling `data.js`. It replaces the stock `benchmark-action/github-action-benchmark` template, which
rendered one Chart.js `<canvas>` per benchmark — an unsearchable, uncategorized wall.

## How it gets published — the two-workflow arrangement

`gh-pages` serves three files:

| File | Owned by | Contents |
|------|----------|----------|
| `index.html` (root) | committed once | redirect to `benchmarks/` |
| `benchmarks/index.html` | **`deploy-dashboard.yml`** | this dashboard |
| `benchmarks/data.js` | **`benchmarks.yml`** | benchmark history (`window.BENCHMARK_DATA`) |

Two workflows cooperate, touching **disjoint files**:

1. **`.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`** — runs BenchmarkDotNet on every push to `main`, appends
   results to `benchmarks/data.js` via `benchmark-action/github-action-benchmark`, and posts
   regression alerts (150% threshold).
   **Key fact:** that action only writes its *default* `index.html` when none exists — it **never
   overwrites** an existing one. So it leaves this custom dashboard alone and only manages `data.js`.

2. **`.github/workflows/deploy-dashboard.yml`** — because the action won't deploy a *custom*
   `index.html`, this workflow does. On any push to `main` that changes `benchmark-dashboard/**`
   (or the workflow itself), and on manual **workflow_dispatch**, it checks out `gh-pages` in a
   worktree, copies `benchmark-dashboard/index.html` into `benchmarks/index.html`, and pushes **only
   if it changed**. It shares the `benchmarks` concurrency group so the two workflows never push
   `gh-pages` at the same time.

## Editing the dashboard

1. Edit `benchmark-dashboard/index.html` on `main` (directly, or via a branch you merge to `main`).
2. The push to `main` triggers `deploy-dashboard.yml`, which syncs it to `gh-pages` automatically.

No manual `gh-pages` commit is needed. **Do not hand-edit `benchmarks/index.html` on `gh-pages`** —
it isn't version-controlled there and the next deploy overwrites it. Edit here instead.

## Previewing locally

The dashboard needs a `data.js` beside it. Grab the live one (this folder's `.gitignore` keeps it
from being committed), then open the file — it works straight from `file://`, no server:

```sh
git show origin/gh-pages:benchmarks/data.js > benchmark-dashboard/data.js
# then open benchmark-dashboard/index.html in a browser
```

Without `data.js` the page still renders but shows "no data".

## Re-deploy / self-heal

If `gh-pages` is ever reset/orphaned, or you want to force a re-sync after an edit:
**Actions → "Deploy Benchmark Dashboard" → Run workflow** (workflow_dispatch).

  /// History / what this guards: the BFT Where implementation once kept a depth-indexed
  /// <c>List&lt;int&gt;</c> (the predicate-skipped-ancestor prefix, <c>_PredSkipPrefix</c>) that
  /// grew to the tree's maximum depth EVEN WHEN NOTHING WAS FILTERED. On a deep degenerate tree
  /// with <c>.Where(_ =&gt; true)</c> (WhereAll -- no node is ever skipped) that list ballooned to
  /// O(depth) (~8.39 MB on a 1M-deep tree) instead of staying O(1). The fix replaced the flat
  /// list with a "tail-carry" prefix that only materializes entries up to the deepest
  /// predicate-skipped ancestor on the current path; with zero skips the stored region stays
  /// empty and the traversal allocates a small, depth-independent constant.
  ///
  /// The bug was purely an ALLOCATION regression -- it never affected the visit stream, whose
  /// correctness is exhaustively covered by Where2InProcessScan. The gh-pages benchmark
  /// (BreadthFirstWhere.DegenerateTree_WhereAll_1M) only *alerts* at 150% with
  /// fail-on-alert: false, so it is not a hard guard. This test is the hard guard.
  ///
  /// Why a RATIO assertion (and not an absolute byte threshold): the regression's signature is
  /// that allocation scales with depth. We therefore measure WhereAll at two depths and assert
  /// that 4x the depth does NOT produce ~4x the allocation. This is robust to runtime/GC/JIT
  /// changes that would shift an absolute byte count, while still catching any return to
  /// O(depth) growth.

  // Breadth-first structural merge (Union). Zips the two operands' BFT visit streams into the BFT
  // traversal of their sibling-index OVERLAY tree.
  //
  // The two inners are themselves base BFT engines, so each produces -- for its own tree, with the
  // consumer's per-(merged-node) strategy forwarded -- the correct BFT choreography: a node's children
  // are SCHEDULED while that node is the inner's front, interleaved only with that node's own
  // between-children revisits, then the node retires. The merge follows both streams in lockstep and
  // emits the OVERLAY tree's choreography, OWNING the revisit cadence: it cannot forward an inner's
  // revisits, because a merged node's child slots are the UNION (by sibling index) of its two inner
  // nodes' slots, and a merged slot earns a revisit iff EITHER side's slot enqueued an accepted node
  // (e.g. a consumer-SkipNode'd internal node that promotes a descendant).
  //
  // MATCHING BY CONSUMED VISIT COUNT, NOT RAW POSITION. Raw positions COLLIDE across subtrees under
  // SkipNode promotion: a promoted node and a real node can share the same (sibling, depth), and two
  // CONSECUTIVE inner visits can share a position. So the merge does NOT match an inner visit to a frame
  // by position. Instead it consumes both inner streams in strict merged order, tracking per frame how
  // many of each inner node's visits it has folded in (Left/RightConsumedVC). A present side's CURRENT
  // visit belongs to the front iff it is a Visiting node at the front's depth whose VisitCount is exactly
  // ConsumedVC + 1 (the node's next visit). Any other state -- a deeper descendant (the front retired in
  // the inner and a child is now its front), a same-depth sibling (VisitCount resets to 1), a scheduling
  // node -- means the front is done on that side. Order guarantees the inner is never advanced past a
  // visit the front still needs, so the position collisions are benign.
  //
  // SKIPSIBLINGS CROSS-PROPAGATION. A consumer SkipSiblings on a merged node N means "N's effective
  // parent has no more children after N", so EVERY later merged sibling of N is dropped regardless of
  // which operand it comes from. The strategy is forwarded to the side(s) N HAS (their inner drops its
  // own remaining siblings), but a single-sided N's later siblings can live in the OTHER operand. So the
  // merge CAPS N's effective parent (the front when N was scheduled, or the forest for an effective root)
  // and, while that parent is still active, PRUNES (SkipNodeAndDescendants) every further node it
  // schedules at N's raw depth or SHALLOWER -- those are N's later effective siblings on either operand.
  // Nodes scheduled DEEPER than N are N's own promoted descendants (SkipNodeAndSiblings keeps them). A
  // capped front owes no further child slots, so it retires once both sides leave its sibling levels.
